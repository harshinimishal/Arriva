## Pain Points (Current System Gaps)

1. **Missed Connections Cause Chaos:** Missing a bus often delays the entire journey; no single app suggests reliable alternatives.  
2. **Fragmented Information:** Live updates are scattered across multiple apps; delayed buses or crowded trains are hard to track.  
3. **Unreliable Travel Predictions:** Arrival times are often inaccurate, creating stress and uncertainty.  
4. **Multiple Payments:** Separate ticketing apps for each transport mode increase friction and slow travel.  
5. **Hidden Delay Reasons:** When buses or trains are delayed, the reason is unclear; Aarav feels helpless.

## Goals (What Aarav Wants)

1. **Predictable Commute:** Know in advance if a bus/train will be late and plan accordingly.  
2. **Adaptive Options:** Receive immediate alternate route suggestions if a connection is missed.  
3. **Transparent Updates:** Understand why delays happen and which route is most reliable.  
4. **Unified Experience:** One app for updates, tickets, and route planning across all transport modes.  
5. **Stress-Free Travel:** Reduce anxiety and wasted time by making commuting smoother and smarter.
