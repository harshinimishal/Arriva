# Problem Understanding: Intelligent Urban Mobility Assistant

Urban commuters depend on multiple public transport modes such as buses, metro, mono, and local trains for daily travel. However, the lack of coordination between these systems results in unreliable journeys, frequent delays, and last-minute confusion.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Unpredictable travel times**  
   Commuters cannot accurately estimate arrival times due to frequent delays and unreliable schedules.

2. **Missed connections with no smart fallback**  
   Missing one bus or train often leads to long waiting times, even when faster alternatives are available nearby.

3. **Fragmented real-time information**  
   Updates are scattered across different apps and platforms, making it difficult to get a single, trusted view of the journey.

4. **Lack of delay transparency**  
   Most systems show that a delay exists but fail to explain why it occurred, reducing user trust.

5. **No predictability or confidence in ETAs**  
   Users are shown arrival times without knowing how reliable those estimates actually are.

6. **Disconnected ticketing systems**  
   Separate payment systems for different transport modes increase friction and slow down travel.

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

1. Focus on single transport modes instead of end-to-end journeys  
2. Provide reactive updates, not predictive insights  
3. Lack adaptive routing when disruptions occur  
4. Fail to present travel information in a clear and transparent manner

## Goal

An intelligent urban mobility assistant that dynamically adapts routes and transport modes in real time to reduce delays, uncertainty, and friction for city commuters.
